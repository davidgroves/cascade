//! Zone storage for [Cascade].
//!
//! [Cascade]: https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/cascade
//!
//! The zone store is an essential part of Cascade. It provides the following
//! functionality:
//!
//! - Storage for the zones loaded by Cascade.
//! - Storage for the signed versions of those zones.
//! - Storage for candidate versions of a zone and rollback.
//! - Identification of different versions of a zone.
//! - Storage for diffs between versions of a zone.
//! - Efficient lookups and traversals over zones.
//! - Persistence of zone data (to/from disk).
//!
//! The zone store is highly memory-efficient and offers parallelized access to
//! stored zones. It is particularly tailored to parallelized signing.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A zone's _contents_ are the DNS records making up the zone. Those records
//! can change over time, leading to different versions, or "instances", of a
//! zone. The zone store organizes its data based on zone instances.
//!
//! Cascade's primary function is to sign zones, transforming an unsigned
//! instance of a zone into a signed one. The signed instance will have all
//! the records of the unsigned one, but adds special signing-related records.
//! The zone store tracks both signed and unsigned instances of zones; signed
//! instances point to the unsigned instance they were created from.
//!
//! In general, it is expected that consecutive instances of a zone (whether
//! signed or unsigned) have few changes between them. The zone store selects
//! an _authoritative instance_ of each zone, compromising signed and unsigned
//! halves; the remaining instances are stored as diffs from this. Older
//! instances of a zone are mostly used as a basis for zone transfers, where
//! their representation as a diff is ideal.
//!
//! Cascade is designed so that there is at most one _upcoming_ instance of a
//! zone at any time. The zone loader and zone signer are capable of building
//! new instances; they do not operate simultaneously. This upcoming instance
//! is expected to have relatively few differences from the authoritative one,
//! and is stored within the same data structure so it can be used efficiently.
//!
//! Authoritative instances are stored in absolute terms, and use specialized
//! data structures for (memory and runtime) efficiency. These are described
//! below.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! Operations on zone contents will typically use the different sets of records
//! in different ways, and separating them at this level is helpful for noticing
//! how different types of records get used.
//!
//! The authoritative contents of a zone are broken down into the following
//! categories:
//!
//! - **Apex records**: These live at the top of the zone and have special
//!   meaning/semantics. Storing them separately makes them easier to access.
//!
//! - **Basic records**: These make up the vast majority of unsigned zone
//!   contents.
//!
//! - **Basic record signatures**.
//!
//! - **Zone cuts**: These are the `NS` and `DS` records delimiting this zone
//!   from its descendants. These are the biggest component of large TLD zones,
//!   and are important to identify for most traversals of a zone.
//!
//! - **Obscured records**: These records lie below zone cuts, and while part of
//!   the zone, are not considered authoritative for the zone. This includes
//!   glue records, and is often ignored (e.g. during signing).
//!
//! - **NSEC and NSEC3 records**: These records identify non-existent portions
//!   of the zone, and are signed to establish the authenticity of `NXDOMAIN`
//!   responses to DNS queries. They are subject to special lookups and so
//!   have special representations.
//!
//! - **NSEC/NSEC3 record signatures**.
//!
//! - **The owner tree**: This is not a set of records, but instead identifies
//!   all record owner names in the zone. It is important for certain lookups
//!   (e.g. to find the descendants of a particular owner) that appear rarely
//!   but need relatively efficient implementation.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! Each of the defined categories uses a special representation for greater
//! efficiency. Different categories are used in different ways, and so have
//! different needs.
//!
//! - Apex records are stored simply; there is a small, constant number of them,
//!   making them trivial to store and look up. They don't need optimization.
//!
//! - Basic records are stored in a hash table, mapping `(owner, RRtype)` to
//!   `RRset` data. Lookups for specific records are very efficient, and the
//!   records can be traversed in parallel.
//!
//!   At the moment, all record types use the same representation, where they
//!   are serialized in the wire format. These records are relatively uncommon
//!   in large TLD zones and so rarely impact memory use.
//!
//! - `NS` records make up the vast majority of large (unsigned) TLD zones.
//!   They are stored in a hash table, mapping owner names to `RRset` data.
//!
//!   `NS` records are typically provided by domain registrars, and they tend to
//!   use the same set of name servers for all their zones. It is very common
//!   to find the same `NS` record set repeated many times in a TLD zone. For
//!   this reason, those record sets are deduplicated and identified by 32-bit
//!   integers. The actual name server lists are stored separately.
//!
//! - While `DS` records are associated with `NS` records, they are not always
//!   present. To avoid adding to the overhead of `NS` records, they are stored
//!   in a separate hash table, with the same mapping.
//!
//! - Obscured records are stored in a hash table, mapping `(owner, RRtype)` to
//!   `RRset` data. Lookups for specific records (e.g. glue for a nameserver)
//!   are fast.
//!
//!   Obscured records tend to be rare and don't need significant optimization
//!   effort. Still, `A` and `AAAA` records are very common here, and it may
//!   be worthwhile to provide specialized representations for them.
//!
//! - NSEC records are stored in a B-tree, sorted by owner name. This tree
//!   represents the NSEC chain for the zone. As a B-tree, it is efficient
//!   to query for the "nearest" or "next" NSEC record.
//!
//!   The data for these records includes the next name in the NSEC chain;
//!   since the tree represents the chain, those next-name fields can be
//!   omitted entirely.
//!
//! - NSEC3 records are stored in a specialized hash table. The leading bits
//!   of the NSEC3 hash (which are naturally uniformly distributed) are used to
//!   index the table. The hash table uses linear probing and maintains the
//!   ordering of entries in probe sequences. This provides fast lookups for
//!   the same "nearest" and "next" queries.
//!
//! - The owner tree is implemented as a hash table, mapping owner names to
//!   nodes. These nodes point to a descendant of that owner name in the tree
//!   (if any); they also form a linked list with sibling nodes. These provide
//!   a fast-enough implementation for discovering the descendants of owner
//!   names; this is important in rare cases involving obscured records.
//!
//! - Signature records (i.e. `RRsig`s) are stored in the same kind of data
//!   structure as the records they sign. While the signature material cannot
//!   be optimized, many of the other fields can be deduplicated.
