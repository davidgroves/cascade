## Unit tests

Unit tests can be run as usual for Rust projects using `cargo test`:

1. `cargo test`
1. `cargo test --no-default-features`
1. `cargo test --all-features`


## Integration/System testing with `act`

The GitHub Action workflow in `integration-tests/system-tests.yml` is currently
only for use with https://github.com/nektos/act via the `act-wrapper` script at
the root of this repository, which creates a custom container with a freshly
built cascade.


### TL;DR

Run all tests with: `./act-wrapper`

Run a single test with: `./act-wrapper --job your-test`

Create a new test with:

- `./integration-tests/scripts/add-test.sh your-test "Your test name"`


### Creating a test

The workflow file `integration-tests/system-tests.yml` only contains "stub"
runners for the tests, with the tests themselves being written in actions in
`integration-tests/tests/`.

You can easily generate the scaffolding for a test with the script
`./integration-tests/scripts/add-test.sh <job-name> "<test name/description>" [<PR-number>]`.

The test environment provides a few nameservers and zones for use in tests
(see section [Provided Nameservers and Zones](#provided-nameservers-and-zones)).


### Running single jobs/tests

You can run single jobs with act using the `--job` option. However, if the job
has the `needs` option set to depend on other jobs, those jobs will always be run
before.


### Overriding the build profile to use

By default tests are run using debug profile builds of the Cascade binaries.
Except for tests that explicitly choose the debug or release build profile, the
build profile used can be overridden by invoking `./act-wrapper` with argument
`--input build-profile=XXX` where XXX must be one of debug or release.


### Overriding the log level to use

By default Cascade is configured to log at debug level. You can change this by
invoking `./act-wrapper` with argument `--input log-level=XXX` where XXX must
be one of error, warning, info, debug or trace.

### Network requirement (why --network default)

In the test environment, Unbound needs to bind to localhost:53, which is not
possible with act's default network. This is because localhost:53 is already in
use by your system's stub resolver (probably systemd-resolved). Instead of
act's default network selection (which instructs Docker/Podman to use the
[host's](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/) network), you
need to specify a different container network to use. Docker and Podman each
provide default networks (not to be confused with act's default network
selection, which is Docker/Podman's `host` network). Docker's default
network is called `default`, while Podman's default network is called `podman`.
Therefore, the `act-wrapper` automatically sets the `--network` option for
`act`. If you want to use a different network than the default one, you can
simply run `act-wrapper --network <your-network>` and it will override the
default network set by the `act-wrapper`.


### Limitations

#### No init or systemd

Act runs the workflow in a container without init or systemd. Therefore, when
running other daemons, you either need to make use of their appropriate
daemonization features, or handle background jobs yourself.

Maybe running act with `--container-options --init` would work to add a dumb
init process, but isn't verified, yet.

#### All nameservers on the same address

Currently, it is not possible to add additional listener addresses on the
loopback (or any) network device in the `act` container. Therefore, all
nameservers are listening on 127.0.0.1 on different ports:

- Unbound: 127.0.0.1:53
- Primary NSD: 127.0.0.1:1055
- Secondary NSD: 127.0.0.1:1054
- Bind (authoritative for `.test`): 127.0.0.1:1053

It might be possible to change this in future versions of this setup with the
`--container-options --cap-add=NET_ADMIN` option for act, but this needs to be
tried out.


### Managing act's verbosity

act prints a lot of information on the terminal. To reduce or manage the amount
of text printed you can:

- Use act's `--concurrent-jobs 1` option to limit the number of jobs run by act
  at once, which will avoid interlacing output of different jobs.
- Use the `--quiet` option to disable logging of output from steps, which
  reduces the amount of output generated by act. However, by using this option
  you might miss valuable output when a test fails and have to re-run the test.
- Write the output to a file with `act ... 2>&1 | tee /tmp/act.log` (optionally
  using `unbuffer` from the `expect` package; left as an excercise for the
  user)


### Running act with Podman

act uses Docker. If you want to use Podman instead, you will need to enable the
Podman daemon and set the DOCKER_HOST variable accordingly. If you are using
rootless Podman, you will likely need to run `systemctl --user enable --now
podman.socket` and set `DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock`
in your shell's rc file (e.g. `.bashrc`). With that set, all docker programs
will use Podman as their backend instead of the Docker daemon. Additionally,
you will need to make sure that `docker` is in your path. As you are using
Podman, you can create a symlink, which instructs Podman to act in a Docker
compatibility mode: `sudo ln -s "$(which podman)" /usr/local/bin/docker`


### Miscellaneous notes

- By default, tests are run using a debug build for both Cascade and dnst.
  - This can be changed per test using the `set-build-profile` action:
    ```
    - uses: ./.github/actions/set-build-profile
      with:
        build-profile: release
    ```
- `cascade`, `cascaded`, and `dnst` are added to the `$PATH`.
- By default, cascade is configured to use the directory:
  `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/cascade-dir`
- The default paths for configuration files can be fetched using the
  `integration-tests/scripts/get-default-path.sh` script (this script is
  intended to be used from the default working directory of the test job; aka
  do not `cd` somewhere, or the reported paths will be wrong).
- The workflow action `.github/actions/setup-and-start-cascade` also generates
  a default policy with `cascade template policy`.
- If you encounter the error `bash: /root/cargo-debug/bin/cascaded: cannot
  execute: required file not found`, you can run `./act-wrapper +build-inside
  ...` to build cascade inside of the container build step. This lacks the
  benefit of cargo's build caching, but works around the issue until it is
  properly fixed.


### Docker dependencies

When using Docker to run the integration tests, you need to make sure that the
`docker-buildx` plugin is installed, otherwise Docker will complain about
unknown flags.

### Provided nameservers and zones

The test environment provides a number of nameservers (a primary NSD,
a secondary NSD, Bind, and the resolver Unbound) and the zone `example.test.`
and it's parent `test.`.

Unbound is used as the system's stub resolver forwarding most queries to Quad9
or Cloudflare. Queries to `test.` are redirected to Bind on port 1053 and
queries to `example.test.` are redirected to the secondary NSD instance on
port 1054.

Bind is configured as an authoritative for the zone `test.` and is used to
enable updating the zone `test.` during a test, e.g. with `dnst update`, to
update the DS RR for `example.test.`, without having to fiddle with modifying
the zonefile (but you still can). (Currently, the zone `test.` is not signed,
which is ok for the current implementation of `dnst keyset`, but this may need
to change in the future.)

Both NSD instances are configured as authoritative for `example.test.`.
The primary NSD loads the zone from a zonefile and provides AXFR and IXFR to
anyone with IP `127.0.0.1`. The secondary NSD is configured to transfer the
zone from Cascade (currently always using AXFR). Both NSD instances allow
notifies from `127.0.0.1`.

### Monitoring resource usage

Using `./act-wrapper +stats-report </path/to/write/report.csv>` or
`./act-wrapper +stats-graph </path/to/write/report.png>` will generate a
report on approximate resource usage covering the period of the execution
of the tests, as CSV raw data and/or as a PNG formatted graph.

Measured resources are CPU and memory, as reported by the `docker stats`
command.

Note that this is only intended to be used when a single test is run at once,
i.e. when using --job XXX or --concurrent-jobs 1. If there are containers
running prior to execution of the tests attempting to use `+stats-report` or
`+stats-graph` or if multiple lines of statistics are output by `docker stats`
(i.e. for more than one active container) an error will be output as the
numbers are assumed to be for a single active container at a time.

Graph generation requires that you have the `gnuplot` tool installed.
