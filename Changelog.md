## 0.1.0-alpha5 'Colline de la Croix'

Released 2025-11-21.

### Breaking changes

- `cascade config reload` has been removed.  Configuration can only be reloaded
  by restarting Cascade.  The command was never fully supported, since changes
  to many configuration settings would be ignored.  ([#330] by @bal-e)

### New

- `cascade debug change-logging` can be used to change how Cascade logs
  information at runtime, which is a useful debugging aid.  This functionality
  was previously provided by `cascade config reload`.  ([#330] by @bal-e)

- `cascade status keys` now prints information about DNSSEC keys and rollovers,
  across all known zones.  It will prioritize keys with the soonest rollover
  actions. ([#288] by @tertsdiepraam)

### Bug fixes

- Changes to the `[key-manager]` section in zone policy will now propagate those
  changes into existing zones for that policy.  ([#355] by @Philip-NLnetLabs)

- The threads spawned by Cascade are now named `cascade-worker` instead of
  generic names like `tokio-worker`.  ([#356] by @tertsdiepraam)

### Documentation improvements

- Note incompatibility with NitroKey v2.0.0 PKCS#11 module ([#357] by @ximon18)

- Note file access limitations for review scripts ([#358] by @tertsdiepraam)

### Acknowledgements

Cascade.

## 0.1.0-alpha4 'Mont-Royal'

Released 2025-11-07.

### New

- The stdout/stderr of review scripts is now logged ([#281] by @tertsdiepraam)
- Cascade now logs its version number on startup ([#286] by @tertsdiepraam)
- Cascade outputs more colorful logs ([#287] by @tertsdiepraam)

### Bug fixes

- Zone parsing errors now cause a soft-halt instead of a hard-halt ([#280] by @tertsdiepraam)
- Signing statistics now present accurate values related to NSEC(3) ([#271] by @bal-e)

### Other changes

- Use `tracing-subscriber` for logging ([#287] by @tertsdiepraam)

### Documentation improvements

- Document Cascade's dependency on OpenSSL ([#277] by @AlexanderBand)

## 0.1.0-alpha3 'Rue des Cascades'

Released 2025-10-24.

### Breaking changes

- Cascade now loads configuration files when it (re)starts, instead of waiting
  for an explicit `cascade config reload` command. ([#258] by @bal-e)

### Bug fixes

- The Cascade CLI only produces color output on terminals, while respecting
  relevant environment variables. Previously it would unconditionally output
  color, even when called from a script or in a pipeline. ([#256] by
  @tertsdiepraam)

- Errors from `cascade keyset` will no longer halt the pipeline ([#265] by
  @tertsdiepraam)

- Resolve systemd startup failure ([#233] by @ximon18)

### Documentation improvements

- General refinement ([#239], [#240], [#241], [#257], [#263], [#264] by
  @AlexanderBand)
- Expand HSM documentation ([#236], [#246], [#259] by @jpmens)
- Add man page for `kmip2pkcs11` ([#260] by @mozzieongit)

### Acknowledgements

Cascade and extensively reporting the issues they found, even contributing
